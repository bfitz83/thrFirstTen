            <p>
                I am a pretty typical Ohio rust-belter. Born in Cleveland, rasied in the suburbs of Loarin, and I have lived throughout
                Northern Ohio. I am the youngest of five children from parents raised in West Virginia. 
            </p>
            <p>
                I studied music composition and theory and recieved my BM from The University of Akron. I also attended
                Cleveland State University for a while working towords an unfinished masters degree. While at CSU I 
                learned the basics of the visual programing language MAX/MSP and also worked as a recording engineer.
                This is where my interest in computers and programing come from.
            </p>
            <p>
                In 2022 I finished a certificate at Lorain County Community College in computer diagnostic and also recieved
                the <a href="https://w3.testout.com/courseware/pc-pro" target="_blank">PC Pro certification from the TestOut Corporation</a>.
                I am currently enroled in the frontend career path at <a href="https://scrimba.com/dashboard#overview" target="_blank">Scrimba</a>, 
                am learning a bit about photo editing with <a href="https://www.gimp.org/" target="_blank">Gimp</a>, 
                and am working towards my <a href="https://www.comptia.org/faq/network/what-is-comptia-network-certification" target="_blank"> CompTIA Net+ certification</a>, all of which I hope to finish in 2023.
            </p>
            <p>
                Besides my current studies I also still play classical guitar and bass from time to time. I mostly enjoy
                Bach and earlier Renessance period music for guitar and love just about anything written for the double bass. 
                I am also a very amuture artist who works
                mostly in graphite and colored pencils. One day I will get around to building a website
                for all of my hobbies, but that still might be a bit away. 
            </p>

                Thank you to everyone who took the time to look around my first project page.
